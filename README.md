A software for the course "Program Designing Experiment" of WHUT.
And more than that.

You're welcome to contribute to this "huge" C(++) project or just "CV" the code here.

Some projects (but I may never made it):
- Make C++ version of it, replacing C-style code to STL and so on.
- Upgrade its IO code.
- Add i18n module.
- Standardize the structure of files of this project and the names of variables and functions.
