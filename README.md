# 计费管理系统 1.0.0
A software for the course "Program Designing Experiment" of WHUT.
And more than that.

You're welcome to contribute to this "huge" C(++) project or just "CV" the code here.

Since C++ style code is not recommended in that course, code in C-style as much as possible.

Some projects (but I may never made it):
- Make C++ version of it, replacing C-style code to STL and so on.
- Upgrade its IO code.
- Add i18n module.
- Add many many annotations.
- Standardize the structure of files of this project and the names of variables and functions.
